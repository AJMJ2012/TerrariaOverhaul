# What's this?
Terraria Overhaul is a huuuge game mechanics changing mod for Terraria. You can read more about it at [this forum page](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/.60369/).

# Where's the source code?
Currently, the mod's latest release is closed sourced, due to code quality issues. However, there's an open source rebuild going on at [the 1.4 branch](https://github.com/Mirsario/TerrariaOverhaul/tree/1.4). Note that it's not a full on rewrite, as a lot of the previous code was already rewritten to a good state. It will take a lot of time, but not too much.

# What's the state of the rebuild?
It's super early, and isn't worth building tModLoader for.
