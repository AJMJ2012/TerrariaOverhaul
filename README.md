# What's this?
Terraria Overhaul is a huuuge game mechanics changing mod for Terraria. You can read more about it at [this forum page](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/.60369/).

# What's the state of the rebuild?
So far, only the most basic features have been reimplemented. Including, but not limited to:
- Camera improvements.
- Footstep sounds.
- Movement changes.
- Bunnyhopping.
- Jump key buffering & auto-jump.
- Players facing the mouse cursor.
- Velocity-based rotation for players.
- Walljumps and wallrolls.
- Climbing.
- NPC Bleeding.
- Grappling hook swinging physics.

They still, however, make a big impact on the game's feel.
