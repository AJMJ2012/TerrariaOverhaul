(Check the mod's homepage for trailers & screenshots)

This is a huge mod, which, instead of adding new content to the game, focuses on adding new gameplay mechanics and completely remaking existing ones.
It remakes melee, ranged and magic combat, adds seasons, dodgerolls, block climbing, walljumps, wallrolls, atmospheric sounds & footsteps, emotes, a weakness & resistance system, makes gore ridiculously enjoyable, adds blood on tiles, a fire and an electricity systems, makes everything more interactive, enhances enemy ai, completely remakes player rendering, makes trees fall like in starbound, and does a thousand more things i can't even memorize.
Believe me, it's colossal.
